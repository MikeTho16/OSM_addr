# The position of a word within the street name impacts how we handle it. For example
# if 'THE' appears as the first work in a street name we want it to be translated
# as 'The', but if appears elsewhere, we want to be translated as 'the'.  All comparisons
# are case insensitive, so for consistency, all patters use upper case letters.  Of
# course the substitutions are case sensitive - otherwise this wouldn't achieve the
# desired outcome.
#
# In the regular expression, the part between ( and ) is the part that gets replaced.
#
# \b - Represents a word boundary so '\b(AND)\b' only matches 'AND' if it is a stand alone
#      word, and doesn't match 'SAND' or 'ANDERSON'.  The word boundary can be the beginning
#      or end of the street name as well as most non alphanumeric characters.
